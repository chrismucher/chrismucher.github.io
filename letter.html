<span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Dear Miami Township Voter,<br /><br />Good Day. My name is Chris Mucher and I am asking for your vote on November 8. It has been my pleasure to have served as one of your Miami Township Trustees since 1996, and I hope you will allow me to continue serving our Township for another term.<br /><br />Today, Miami Township is healthy and strong.  We have a vibrant economy built on a solid agricultural base.  It contains a State Park, a Nature Preserve, as well as two Villages that are the envy of every other municipality in Ohio.  Since taking office, protecting our Township and securing its future have always been my priorities.          <br /><br />During my tenure as Miami Township Trustee I have focused on prudent development, land preservation, encouraging job creation, and protecting our natural and cultural resources by:<br /></span>

<ul class="disc"><li><span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Entering into a Cooperative Economic Development Agreement (CEDA) with the Village of Yellow Springs to keep high quality services in the Village while inhibiting skyrocketing property taxes. </span></li>

<li><span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Joining Community Resources working to build a new Commerce Park which will bring new jobs to Miami Township.</span></li>

<li><span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Serving on the Yellow Springs Sourcewater Protection Committee overseeing the public information and toxic clean-up campaigns of the YSI chemical spill that threatened drinking water in the southern section of Miami Township.</span></li>

<li><span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Heading the Grinnell Mill Preservation Committee in order to acquire the historic Grinnell Mill from Antioch University and keep this unique 180 year old timber frame structure from being torn down and lost forever.</span></li>

<li><span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Partnering with the Tecumseh Land Trust in order to preserve over 2200 acres of prime farmland in the Township.</span></li></ul>


<span class="MsoNormal" style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">     While the Township is in great shape now, there are upcoming challenges that must be addressed so that Miami Township can continue to remain as strong as ever.  In particular, we have to address the economic pressures that come from funding cuts in the State of Ohio, shrinking property tax revenues from Greene County due to decreasing appraisal values, and the reduction in gasoline tax and motor vehicle license revenue. These are serious issues and will require tough decisions that need to be based on experience and a thorough knowledge of Township finances.  In addition, the Miami Township Fire and Rescue Department, which I consider as the best Department in the Miami Valley, has a crucial issue to confront in dealing with a 55-year-old fire station that is woefully inadequate to the needs of a modern emergency services department. The current station&rsquo;s lack of space, its limited parking, and its terrible energy efficiency means that our excellent MTFRD cannot house the state-of-the art technology and equipment that such a valuable institution and dedicated team of volunteers deserve. Over the next few years, your elected Township Trustees must choose to support our Fire Department by making thoughtful, knowledgeable decisions that balance fiscal responsibility with the safety of all Miami Township residents.<br /><br />     I believe I am the best candidate to lead our Township for the next four years. I have the knowledge, the experience and the dedication to work hard, every day, to secure a bright, stable future for Miami Township. Thank you for your support this November!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Chris Mucher<br /></span>
