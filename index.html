                <p>Dear Friend,</p>

                <p>Welcome to chrismucher.com, a resource I've put together to help inform voters about myself and my views for Miami Township. It has been my pleasure to serve as township trustee for these past 19 years, and with your help I'll be able to continue working on behalf of our township. If re-elected, I'll focus my efforts to provide the best facilities and equipment for our township Fire/Rescue and Road Departments. Additionally, I will continue to support the adoption of a Comprehensive Land Use Plan and continue the partnership with the Village to promote economic development within areas of Miami Township designated in the CEDA agreement.</p>

                <p>Take a few moments and browse my website. The <a class="page-scroll" href="#accomplishments">accomplishments</a> section below highlights the projects that I've undertaken and completed while serving as your township trustee.</p>

                <p>Thank you for your vote and your support on November 3th.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,<br>
                Chris Mucher<br>
                Miami Township Trustee</p>
