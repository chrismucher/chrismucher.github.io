    <blockquote>
      <font face="century gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
      <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><font face="arial" color="#ffffff">The people 
      of Miami Township respect the past while planning for the future. With its 
      history and economy rooted in agriculture, Miami Township has consistently 
      been in the forefront in the effort to preserve farmland. No other 
      Township in Greene County or for that matter, in the Miami Valley, can 
      claim as many acres of Township land protected from development by the use 
      of agricultural conservation easements. There are almost 3500 acres of 
      protected land in Miami Township consisting of 1700 acres of public land 
      such as John Bryan Park and Glen Helen as well as nearly 1800 acres of 
      private property including the historic Whitehall Farm in the northern 
      portion of the Township. In 1998, Miami Township, the Village of Yellow 
      Springs, Greene County and an army of private individuals from as far away 
      as California voted with their wallets to prevent the almost 950 acre farm 
      from being broken up into building lots. Since 2003, the Tecumseh Land Trust along with property owners and Miami Township have applied to the State of Ohio's Department of Farmland Prevention for grants to acquire and additional 1250 acres of protected farmland in the township. Miami 
      Township understands the need for balance in its economic sectors and as 
      such is partnering with the Village of Yellow Springs in a Cooperative 
      Economic Development Agreement or CEDA. The intent of this CEDA is to 
      promote healthy economic growth that would benefit both the Village and 
      the Township while protecting agricultural areas by keeping commercial 
      areas within the municipal boundaries of the Village. In an effort to 
      continue the practice of managed growth well into the future, Miami 
      Township has begun work on a long-range comprehensive land use plan. With 
      the adoption of such a plan, future decisions regarding zoning and 
      development will reflect a direction previously set forth as a result of 
      input by all the residents of Miami Township. </font></p>
